Notes:

- The files in the "docs" folder is subject to change, and may not reflect
  the current state of the project.
- Oswald is currently designed for applications that want to use an external
  graphics API like OpenGL or DirectX.
    - In Windows, this means that the window owns a device context, so GDI
      functions may not work as expected.
